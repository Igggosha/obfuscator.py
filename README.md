Hello everyone! I am Igggosha. 
I am a starting coder and a starter github user, so I decided to create a simple project that might at some point help someone at some point.
# -----------
obfuscator.py is an extremely simple pre-junior level of program, utilising simple integrated and os library parts to create a very little utility
to help vanish deleted data from the hard drive. Launch the program, enter the value (recommended - higher than 100 and lover than 1000). The higher the value, the more
chances that the deleted data will indeed be overwritten by a lot of huge .txt files. 
# -----------
I kinda hope to make is more user friendly or even move it to something like c++ in the future to increase compatibility but time will show.
Setting values over 200 is up to you - the power increases exponentially: 100 will clear up around 2 GB, 300 will take 30 Gb and 1000 will clear a whole 280 GB
of storage! So better be careful with the values, heh.
